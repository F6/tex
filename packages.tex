% in Chinese documents, a new paragraph is indicated by indenting width of 2 
% Chinese chars at the beginning. This can be done with 
%  \setlength{\parindent}{21pt}  when we use a 10.5 pt font. 
% However, the parindent indents every new paragraph, which is obviously not 
% favorable for us because when we insert an equation, we typically do not want 
% to start a new paragraph, so the next lines should not be indented.
% I think the most robust way to indent the paragraphs for now is to use a 
% simple command at the begining of every new paragraph.
% we create a new command here because if we want to change the indentation 
% length later, we can always just modify this command.
